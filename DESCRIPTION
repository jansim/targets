Title: Targets R Package User Manual
Description: This repository is the targets R package user manual.
  It contains in-depth discussion and walkthroughs
  of the main features of 'targets' and advice about best practices.
  The goal is to introduce new users to 'targets' and instill
  a thorough understanding of what it does, how it works,
  and when to use it. The manual is implemented as a typical
  'bookdown' project with a single '_bookdown.yml' file at the top level
  and one R Markdown source file for each chapter. End users
  are encouraged to read the rendered output at
  <https://books.ropensci.org/targets>.
